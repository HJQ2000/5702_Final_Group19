We want to studyn saftey in New York City. It is always heard that New York City is not a very safe place to live. As students new to the city, we want to find out is the rumor true or false and where would be a safest region in New York City. This might be helpful information for us to choose regions to live for next year or so as well. For this purpose, we are going to use NYPD Complaint Data Historic from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i, and narrow down the date range to more recent 5 years.
