# Introduction

In this project, We want to study the safe issue in the New York City. It is always heard that New York City is dangerous for living with a high crime rate. As students new to the city, we want to find out if the rumor is true or not. We also would like to understand the detailed crime situations and distributions in the city, such as where would be the safest areas in NYC, when the crimes usually happen, and what kind of crimes happen more frequently. These information can help people newly coming to NYC to have a better sense of the city's safe status and choose safe areas to live and socialize in order to better protect themselves. For this purpose, we are going to use NYPD Complaint Data Historic in recent years for the analysis.
