It is always heard that New York City is dangerous for living with a high crime rate. As students new to the city, we want to find out if the rumor is true or not. We also would like to understand the detailed crime situations and distributions in the city, such as where would be the safest areas in NYC, when the crimes usually happen, and what kind of crimes happen more frequently. These information can help people newly coming to NYC to have a better sense of the city’s safe status and choose safe areas to live and socialize in order to better protect themselves. For this purpose, we are going to use NYPD Complaint Data Historic in recent years for the analysis. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Our project focuses on researching the safety situation in the New York City. We aim to answer questions like “Where are the safest regions to live in terms of low violence? What kind of crimes happen in the city? Where do they usually occur and how serious are they?”. In the metropolitan areas, the safety concern is shown as the occurrence of the crime. The time and location of the crime occurrence, types of crimes conducted, information about criminals and suspects, crime occurrence frequency are possible factors we care about. 2.2 Data availability We use the NYPD Complaint Data Historic data, which is available on the NYC OpenData website (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i). The data is provided and maintained by the New York Police Department (NYPD), owned by NYC OpenData. It is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the NYPD. The data can be exported in different formats, including CSV, CSV for Excel, XML, RDF, and RSS. The dataset can be directly downloaded from the website or with API. For this project, we are more interested in the information in recent years, so we narrow down the date range to 2017/01/01-2020/01/01. We plan to select the specific date range on the website and directly download the dataset from the website in CSV format. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources We’d like to find integrated data sets from the official website for research. Such data is more comprehensive and accurate, and it is also conducive to our data processing and analysis. Thus we choose NYC OpenData as our data sources. We tried to find data related to violence in New York City, so we decided to use complaint data of crime in NYC. The dataset contains valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the NYPD from 2006 to the end of 2019. Each record represents a criminal complaint in NYC. There are 35 columns including features like the type of crime, the location and time of enforcement, and the suspect and victim information. If we have any questions about the data, we can send a note to NYC OpenData (NYC Open Data - Contact Us (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/engage/)). There are several known issues relating to data quality. First, the dataset contains some null values, if the data was not collected or not available at the time of report. This may lead to bias in our study of the distribution of the data. Second, the dataset is released based on the date the incident was reported, but some crimes may have occurred years before they were reported. Also, some crimes that were not able to be geo-coded at the crime spot have been recorded as occurring at the police station house within the precinct of occurrence. This will cause a certain bias in the geographical analysis, but this bias can be avoided by appropriately expanding the geographical scope when grouping. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation We directly downloaded the data from the website and saved in a CSV file. When downloading, we filtered out the date range we are interested in - from 2017/01/01 to 2020/01/01. Most of the features in the dataset are in text format, and numeric values are in correct scales and format, so the data transformation is not necessary. There are several features where most of the information is not recorded, like name of NYC park, playground or greenspace of occurrence, name of NYCHA housing development of occurrence, and transit district in which the offense occurred, so we would not include them in our analysis. Also, there are pairs of features showing the same information, such as offense classification code &amp; code description, internal offense class code &amp; code description, jurisdiction code &amp; code description. As the code itself would not tell much information about the features, we removed these codes and only kept the corresponding short description the code refers to. 3.3 Missing value analysis We performed analysis on missing values to see if there are any patterns of the missing data. We first wanted to know the amount of missing data in each feature and which feature(s) contain insufficient data to perform the analysis with. From the distribution of missing data of features with missing values, we can see that “TRANSIT_DISTRICT” (transit district in which the offense occurred) and “HOUSING_PSA” (development level code) have about 97% and 30% of missing rows separately, which are the top two features with missing values among 35 features. There are also other features with rows missing values, such as “PD_CD” (internal classification code) and “JURISDICTION_CODE”, but the percentages are below 1%, which are not explicitly displayed in the plot. In addition to the percentage of missing values in each feature, we can also show the missing patterns. By choosing four variables with largest number of missing values, there are 6 missing patterns in the dataset, where about 65% of rows belong to the first pattern and over 25% of rows in the second pattern. Therefore, there are lots of rows missing data in several features, as it’s impossible to fill these values as they are categorial features with text data, so we decided to remove them in the analysis. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Variables 4.2 Relationships 4.3 WHAT’S ABOUT MANHATTAN", " Chapter 4 Results Here, we analyze each variable one by one to see how the crime rate changes under different categories. 4.1 Variables 4.1.1 RPT_DT Variable “RPT_DT” is the date that the event was reported to police. From the Time Series plot, we found that the year-to-year crime trends were similar, with lower numbers at the beginning and end of the year and higher numbers in the middle of the year. Therefore, we break down the number of crimes by month. And defined 8:00-20:00 is the time period for “day” and the rest as “night”. Within the barplot we found that twice as many crimes occur at day than during the night. Both day and night, crimes are higher between May to October and lowest in February. This may be because February is the month with the fewest days. The number of crimes at day is similar across the months, while during the night there is a distinct single peak in July. This may be due to the fact that from February to July the weather gets warmer and people become more active and social, and therefore more potential accidents. Temperatures drop between July and December, and the number of crimes drops slightly. 4.1.2 OFNS_DESC Variable “OFNS_DESC” is the crime description of corresponding to the offense event. As we can see from the Cleveland dot plot below, in the New York area, the most committed crime was “Petit Larceny”. Appeared more than 200,000 times from 2017 to 2019. Besides, the crimes of harrassment also exceed 200,000 times and crimes of assault &amp; related offenses, criminal mischief, grand larceny exceed 100,000 times. These were the types of crimes that occurred the most during the three-year period. They are sudden crimes and mainly threaten personal financial security.It can be found that most of the crimes that occur more frequently are misdemeanors, and felonies are mainly grand larceny, which poses less threat to life safety. 4.1.3 LAW_CAT_CD, BORO_NM Variable “LAW_CAT_CD” is the level of offense, it contains felony, misdemeanor and violation. Variable “BORO_NM” is the name of the borough in which the incident occurred. As we can see from the Horizontal Stacked Bar chart, Brooklyn has the most crimes and Staten Island has the least. This may be caused by the population gap, but still reminds us of the security situation in different regions. At the same time, from the perspective of crime level, most crimes are misdemeanors, and the number of serious crimes is second. But in terms of seriousness, felony causes greater personal harm and social impact, so we need to pay more attention to its data. In terms of numbers, the Brooklyn area had the highest number of felony crimes. But in terms of proportion, the proportion of felony crimes in each region is near 20%. 4.1.4 PREM_TYP_DESC Variable “PREM_TYP_DESC” is specific description of where the crime occurred, e.g. grocery store, home, street, etc. This graph shows the crime counts in different areas from 2017 to 2019. The most crimes occurred on the street, followed by residential apartment house, with more than 100,000 crimes during three years. Crimes occurred in each year is similar, there is no sudden decrease or sudden increase. 4.1.5 Latitude and Longitude This part contains two variables “Latitude” and “Longitude”. As we can see from the histogram of crime frequency count corresponding to latitude and longitude, there are multi peaks in both graphs. This might indicate that there are some regions with more crimes happened. For example, there is a peak around 40.755 on latitude and a peak around -73.99 on longitude. Locating (40.755, -73.99) is somewhere near time square. The data might suggest that there are more crime happend near around this region. From the scatter plot and 2D histogram, we can see that Manhattan and Bronx has densest crime happened, then is Brooklyn, Queens, and last Staten Island. The crimes happened in central park is rare according to both graphs, suggesting that it might be a safe place on Manhattan. The 2d histogram again confirm our previous guess that there are many crimes happened near time square. 4.1.6 Age_group This part contains two variables “SUSP_AGE_GROUP” and “VIC_AGE_GROUP”. These records the ages of suspects and victims of offense, helping us better understand the characteristics of suspects and helping us identify potential threats. Ignoring the group of unknown, we see that both suspects and victims are concentrated between 25-44 years old. The numbers of both suspects and victims gradually decrease as age decreases before 25 years old or increases after 44 years old. 4.1.7 Race This part also contains two variables “SUSP_RACE” and “VIC_RACE”. These records the race of suspects and victims of offense. Sorted by suspect’s race, ignoring UNKNOWN group, We found that the race with the more suspects, the more victims. Blacks have the most suspects and victims, which reminds us that the living environment of blacks in New York may be worse than other races. 4.2 Relationships 4.2.1 SEX &amp; law_cat_cd This mosaic plot showed us the relationship between suspect’s and victim’s sex and the level of offenses. Among all crimes, male suspects accounted for the highest proportion. Female suspects take a relatively large proportion of the level of violation, and the proportion of female suspects gradually decreasing as the severity of the offenses increases. Sex Description: D=Business/Organization, E=PSNY/People of the State of New York, F=Female, M=Male, U=Unknown 4.2.2 Suspect &amp; Victim From the alluvial plot, compared the suspect and victims’ sex, we can see that female victims involve in a crime having a male suspect, and male suspect choose female victim as top target. From the perspective of race, we see that crimes more likely to happen between peers from same race. We see that blacks and black hispanic has more suspects than victims. For victims from almost all races, the largest proportion of corresponding suspect comes from same race, the second largest proportion of corresponding suspect comes from Blacks(except for AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKAN NATIVE where the race of most suspect is Black and second largest is same, and Black where the second largest is White Hispanic). From the perspective of age group, we see that crimes more likely to happen between peers from same age group. The percentage of crime decreases as age difference enlarges. One thing we notice is that for suspects aging below 18, the percentage of victim aging between 18 and 24 is less than 25-44 age range and even less than 45-64 age range. 4.3 WHAT’S ABOUT MANHATTAN Columbia University is located in the uptown area of Manhattan, where most of the students live. Besides, compared with misdemeanors, felonies are more harmful to human safety, so we further study the felony situation in Manhattan. From the heatmap, we can see that Grand Larceny has occurred in various places and the number of occurrences is the highest. Most crimes are distributed in a wide range, and there is no specific premise for occurrence. Based on this, we further check the distribution of “Grand Larceny” which had the highest number of felony crimes in Manhattan. From the picture, we can found that the number and density of grand larceny on the left side of Central Park are lower than those on the right side. There is one crime-intensive area in upper Manhattan and lower Manhattan, students may pay more attention to their property and safety when visit these two areas. The crimes areas are similar during the day and night, but there are more crimes during the day. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component Here is the link for the d3 interactive graphs. https://vizhub.com/HJQ2000/1d9a9d8c1736439b8fadedce320654e7 It is a combination of bar plot and 2d histogram to show count and density for top frequency crimes in each borough. It gives freedom to see crime counts for crime types that we are interested in. Experimenting with the crime types, we found that even Brooklyn has the most crimes happened in numbers in total, Manhattan has higher occurance of larceny. If one or some crime types are chosen, clicking on each bar will create a 2d histogram showing the density of the crime types chosen at the borough clicked on. If too mnay crimes type are chosen, it might take a while to generate. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion When traveling to live and study in a new area, safety is closely related to us and is one of our top concerns. Thus, our project analyzes NYPD Complaint Data Historic and visualizes the number of crimes, crime areas, crime types, and the characteristics of suspects and victims. 1. What are the characteristics of crime volume trends over time? From the perspective of year, the trend in the number of crimes per year is similar, with lower numbers at the beginning and end of the year and higher numbers in the middle of the year. In terms of months, the number of crimes was the least in February, this may be because February is the month with the fewest days. It could also be because of the Super Bowl! Twice as many crimes occur at day than during the night, this is because most crimes are misdemeanors like theft, which occur more during the day. Although there are fewer crimes at night, most of the crimes are felonies. 2. What are the most frequent offenses? Petit Larceny, Harassment and Assault are the most reported crimes. 3. Which area has the most crimes? Brooklyn had the highest crime rate, while Staten Island had the lowest. This may be due to population differences. Viewed from map, Manhattan and Bronx has densest crime. From the heatmap, Times Square area is the most crime-intensive place, but in-depth analysis of crime types in this area is Petit Larceny. Crowds are more prone to have offense. 4. What are the characteristics of suspects and victims? People are more likely to be attacked by suspects who are similar to themselves, regardless of age, sex or race. 5. Where are the safest regions to live in Manhattan? It looks like that the west side of Manhattan has fewer cases and is safer than the east side. The Midlands is less crime-intensive than Uptown and Downtown. Central Park has minimal crime but no residential areas. There is also a blank area in the upper left corner of the map, which is the location of Columbia University. Living near the school is also safer than other places. 6. Suggestions: In the case of people gathering, students need to pay more attention to their safety. It is a good choice to live near Central Park West, midtown Manhattan and Columbia University. Most of the crimes are more like temporary crimes, it is more difficult to prevent them. But most of them do not threaten the safety of life, and if necessary, part of the properties can be lost in exchange for safety. Hoping everyone stay away from offenses and stay safe!
