It is always heard that New York City is not a very safe place to live. As students new to the city, we want to find out if the rumor is true or not and where would be the safest regions in New York City. This might be helpful information for us to choose regions to live for next year or so as well. For this purpose, we are going to use NYPD Complaint Data Historic from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i, and narrow down the date range to more recent 3 years.

Such data is more comprehensive and accurate, and it is also conducive to our data processing and analysis. Thus we choose NYC OpenData as our data sources. We tried to find data related to violence in New York City, so we decided to use complaint data of crime in NYC. The data is provided and maintained by the New York Police Department (NYPD), owned by NYC OpenData. This data is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the NYPD. Each record represents a criminal complaint in NYC and includes information about the type of crime, the location and time of enforcement. It can be directly downloaded from the NYC OpenData website in the CSV format, so we can simply import the CSV file. The dataset contains valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the NYPD from 2006 to the end of 2019. We download the dataset in a .csv file, and filter out earlier complaints before 2016. If we have any questions about the data, we can send a note to NYC OpenData (NYC Open Data - Contact Us (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/engage/)). Known issues relating to data quality: The dataset contains some null values, because the data was not collected or not available at the time of report. This may lead to bias in our study of the distribution of the data. The dataset is released based on the date the incident was reported, but some crimes may have occurred years before they were reported. Some crimes that were not able to be geo-coded have been located as occurring at the police station house within the precinct of occurrence. This will cause a certain bias in the geographical analysis, but this bias can be avoided by appropriately expanding the geographical scope when grouping. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results", " Chapter 4 Results "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
