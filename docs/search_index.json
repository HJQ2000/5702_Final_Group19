It is always heard that New York City is not a very safe place to live. As students new to the city, we want to find out if the rumor is true or not and where would be the safest regions in New York City. This might be helpful information for us to choose regions to live for next year or so as well. For this purpose, we are going to use NYPD Complaint Data Historic from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i, and narrow down the date range to more recent 3 years.

Such data is more comprehensive and accurate, and it is also conducive to our data processing and analysis. Thus we choose NYC OpenData as our data sources. We tried to find data related to violence in New York City, so we decided to use complaint data of crime in NYC. The data is provided and maintained by the New York Police Department (NYPD), owned by NYC OpenData. This data is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the NYPD. Each record represents a criminal complaint in NYC and includes information about the type of crime, the location and time of enforcement. It can be directly downloaded from the NYC OpenData website in the CSV format, so we can simply import the CSV file. The dataset contains valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the NYPD from 2006 to the end of 2019. We download the dataset in a .csv file, and filter out earlier complaints before 2016. If we have any questions about the data, we can send a note to NYC OpenData (NYC Open Data - Contact Us (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/engage/)). Known issues relating to data quality: The dataset contains some null values, because the data was not collected or not available at the time of report. This may lead to bias in our study of the distribution of the data. The dataset is released based on the date the incident was reported, but some crimes may have occurred years before they were reported. Some crimes that were not able to be geo-coded have been located as occurring at the police station house within the precinct of occurrence. This will cause a certain bias in the geographical analysis, but this bias can be avoided by appropriately expanding the geographical scope when grouping. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Variables 4.2 Relationships", " Chapter 4 Results Here, we analyze each variable one by one to see how the crime rate changes under different categories. 4.1 Variables 4.1.1 RPT_DT Variable “RPT_DT” is the date that the event was reported to police. From the Time Series plot, we found that the year-to-year crime trends were similar, with lower numbers at the beginning and end of the year and higher numbers in the middle of the year. Therefore, we break down the number of crimes by month. Crimes are higher from May to October and highest in July, lowest in February. 4.1.2 OFNS_DESC Variable “OFNS_DESC” is the crime description of corresponding to the offense event. As we can see from the Cleveland dot plot below, in the New York area, the most committed crime was “Petit Larceny”. Appeared more than 200,000 times from 2017 to 2019. Besides, the crimes of harrassment also exceed 200,000 times and crimes of assault &amp; related offenses, criminal mischief, grand larceny exceed 100,000 times. These were the types of crimes that occurred the most during the three-year period. They are sudden crimes and mainly threaten personal financial security. 4.1.3 LAW_CAT_CD, BORO_NM Variable “LAW_CAT_CD” is the level of offense, it contains felony, misdemeanor and violation. Variable “BORO_NM” is the name of the borough in which the incident occurred. As we can see from the Horizontal Stacked Bar chart, Brooklyn has the most crimes and Staten Island has the least. This may be caused by the population gap, but still reminds us of the security situation in different regions. At the same time, from the perspective of crime level, most crimes are misdemeanors, and the number of serious crimes is second. But in terms of seriousness, felony causes greater personal harm and social impact, so we need to pay more attention to its data. In terms of numbers, the Brooklyn area had the highest number of felony crimes. But in terms of proportion, the proportion of felony crimes in each region is near 20%. 4.1.4 PREM_TYP_DESC Variable “PREM_TYP_DESC” is specific description of where the crime occurred, e.g. grocery store, home, street, etc. The most crimes occurred on the street, followed by residential apartment house, with more than 300,000 crimes during three years. 4.1.5 Age_group This part contains two variables “SUSP_AGE_GROUP” and “VIC_AGE_GROUP”. These records the ages of suspects and victims of offense, helping us better understand the characteristics of suspects and helping us identify potential threats. Ignoring the group of unknown, we see that both suspects and victims are concentrated between 25-44 years old. Both suspects and victims gradually decrease as age decreases before 25 years old or increases after 44 years old. 4.1.6 Race This part also contains two variables “SUSP_RACE” and “VIC_RACE”. These records the race of suspects and victims of offense. Sorted by suspect’s race, ignoring UNKNOWN group, We found that the race with the more suspects, the more victims. Blacks have the most suspects and victims, which reminds us that the living environment of blacks in New York may be worse than other races. 4.2 Relationships 4.2.1 SUSP_SEX &amp; law_cat_cd This mosaic plot showed us the relationship between suspect’s sex and the level of offenses. Among all crimes, male suspects accounted for the highest proportion. Female suspects take a relatively large proportion of the level of violation, and the proportion of female suspects gradually decreasing as the severity of the offenses increases.
